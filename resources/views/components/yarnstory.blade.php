                A fashion collection is a curated group of clothing, footwear, and
                accessories designed around a central theme, concept, or inspiration,
                unified by shared colors, fabrics, silhouettes, and styles for a specific
                season (like Spring/Summer or Fall/Winter) to tell a cohesive story and
                predict trends. These collections often blend trendy, limited-edition
                pieces with timeless basics, creating a complete look that designers
                present to buyers and the public, often during Fashion Weeks.
