                    A fashion collection is a curated group of clothing, footwear, and accessories designed around a
                    central
                    theme, concept, or inspiration, unified by shared colors, fabrics, silhouettes, and styles for a
                    specific season (like Spring/Summer or Fall/Winter) to tell a cohesive story and predict trends.
                    These
                    collections often blend trendy, limited-edition pieces with timeless basics, creating a complete
                    look
                    that designers present to buyers and the public, often during Fashion Weeks.
