                    A fashion collection is a curated group of clothing, footwear, and
                    accessories designed around a central theme, concept, or
                    inspiration, unified by shared colors, fabrics, silhouettes, and
                    styles for a specific season (like Spring/Summer or Fall/Winter) to
                    tell a cohesive story and predict trends. These collections often
                    blend trendy, limited-edition pieces with timeless basics, creating
                    a complete look that designers present to buyers and the public,
                    often during Fashion Weeks.
